I need to run:
npm add @babel/runtime

ServerRoutes/admin.js
L2:
"../Data-Base/Admin/admin" not "../Data-Base/Admin/Admin"

Avoid using dash on title:
FREELANCER-SIGNUP

Correct the title for /ClientSignup

You could use images for pages more related to subject
of the page (Login/Signup for FreeLancer/Client pages)

NavBar
Custom font for your website name 
custom style for active link
Why home login as client links has different style
button to open side bar should be smaller and in the some ligne as website title
and appear in smaller screen
Home Page
Custom font for text in landing page add text-shadow
to make it more clear
Learn more button use font-weight bold with icon


It will be better to have directories one for routes and one for layouts

FreeLancerSignup Page:
image disappear on small page
password confirm password could be in the some lign in big screens
First and last name should be in diffirant ligne in small screens

Use format Document after finishing the file
Why you are using Switch in many components
You call footer component about(h6 footer)
don't use heading for style

You need to decide early if you will use Freelancer or artist
